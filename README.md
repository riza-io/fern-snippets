# fern-example

This repo uses Riza to validate snippets for documentation generated by Fern. Snippets are collected from a site's `llm.txt` file. While this should be adaptable to any Fern docs site, this example runs snippets from the [Elevenlabs](https://elevenlabs.io/docs) and [Cohere](https://docs.cohere.com/).


## Instructions

First, create or access your [Riza organization](riza.io).

Next you'll need to create a Custom Runtime for typescript or python so that Riza has the correct packages at runtime

`package.json`
```json


```

`requirements.txt`
```
pydub
elevenlabs
ffmpeg
python-dotenv
fastapi
openai
cohere
```

Once you have the custom runtime builts, grab the revision ID and an API key and add them to a `.env` file in the root of this project.

You will also need API specific keys for cohere and elevenlabs


This project uses Bun, installation instructions can be found here https://bun.sh/

Finally, install dependencies
```bash
bun install
```

And run the examples!

```bash
bun run index.ts provider language
```

- Where `provider` is either `cohere` or `elevenlabs`
- Where `langauge is either `typescript` or `python`


### Replacing snippets
If you want to get a fresh copy of the snippets, download the file from [Elevenlabs](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/llms-full.txt) or [Cohere](https://docs.cohere.com/llms-full.txt) and replace the corresponding `.txt` files in this repo
